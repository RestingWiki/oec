            <p>
                <strong>OISP English Club (OEC)</strong> is the <strong>sole English club</strong> under <strong>Office for Education Programs (OISP)</strong>
                at Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Established in 2017, <strong>OEC</strong> was created with the goal of providing a friendly and beneficial environment for
                students who are deeply passionate about the English language. With the slogan <strong><em>“Never give up - OEC speaks up”</em></strong>,
                not only does <strong>OEC</strong> aim to build a friendly environment, but also organizes academic competitions to spread English
                into all aspects of life, overcoming the language barrier for students at VNU-HCMUT.
